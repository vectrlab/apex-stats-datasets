# APEX STATS Dataset Library

This is a library of public datasets cleaned and ready for use with any APEX STATS code snippet. There are no missing cases or erroneous values. The original messy dataset is separately available and could be used to teach data cleaning. Datasets include a guide that explains the data and gives suggestions for potentially interesting analyses.

## Quick Start

If you are new to APEX STATS, start with the <a href="https://github.com/vectrlab/apex-stats-modules/">Modules</a>.

## About APEX STATS

APEX STATS is a set of open, editable, and modular resources that use Python as instructional technology to make it easier to teach introductory statistics.

The goal of the APEX STATS modules is to teach statistical reasoning and concepts through examples that incorporate Python. The modules expose students to Python gradually and provide opportunities for them to modify code to perform analysis. Prior Python background is not necessary to progress through the modules. Students will grow more comfortable with Python as they discover its usefulness. Instructors can use APEX STATS modules to teach statistical concepts without needing to emphasize Python. Meanwhie, the Python code is always visible and editable for students and instructors to discover the fun challenge of computer programming.

APEX STATS is aligned to the California Transfer and Articulation System, <a href="https://www.c-id.net">C-ID</a>, for <a href="https://www.c-id.net/descriptors/final/show/365">Introduction to Statistics</a>. It offers 100% coverage of C-ID learning objectives and all listed topics except binomial distributions. Therefore, it should be useful for many introductory statistics courses and any California college course. 

APEX is the <a href="https://sjsu.edu/apex/">Applied Computing Programming Experiences</a> project at San Jos&eacute; State University.
